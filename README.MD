This project is a simple, interactive calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<!-- Tools & Technologies Used -->

HTML: Structured the layout.
CSS: Styled the calculator with a modern, responsive design.
JavaScript: Handled the logic for calculations and user interactions.

<!-- JavaScript Development Approach -->

1. DOM Manipulation: Used document.getElementById and querySelectorAll to select and update elements dynamically.
2. Event Handling: Attached event listeners to buttons for number inputs, operators, and clearing the display.
3. State Management: Stored currentValue, previousValue, and operator variables to track calculations.
4. Calculation Logic: Used an object-based approach (operations object) to perform arithmetic operations efficiently.
5. User Experience: Ensured smooth functionality with decimal handling, immediate result updates, and a reset function.

This approach ensures clean, maintainable code while keeping the logic efficient and user-friendly. 🚀
